# Valoref: Valorant Reference ðŸŽ®

## The App
Valoref is an app desined to act as a reference and strategy guide for players while they play Valorant, an online multiplayer video game.

## Speed

Valoref was made using Gatsby with the intention of serving the fastest possible static site with as much rendering handled server side as possible to speed up the runtime for the end user. In addition, Valoref makes use of GraphQL and Sharp to query for images at an incredibly low latency as well as to process and allow for resize rendering at high speeds, something highly necessary when gamers are tabbing back and forth mid game round looking for strategies to implement.  

Valoref was created by Kiera Patel, Anujan Mathisekaran, and Jason Liu. Designs, UX research and more can be found at https://www.kierapatel.com/valoref.
