## The Problem

This app was created to solve a real-world problem that players of the highly popular video game, Valorant were facing. 
User research was conducted using surveys and user interviews to figure out what makes the game so challenging. On a likert scale ranging from very easy to very difficult, 67% of the users interviewed rated it anywhere from difficult to very difficult to accurately throw a smoke without using an external online resource.

## The Solution

Valoref is an easy-to-access reference for Valorant players that can be used during the game to quickly see how to line up a smoke in order for it to land precisely where they want. It shows the exact detailed steps necessary to gain an advantage on an opponent using the specific character you chose and their associated abilities. 

A map is featured to display smokes and their specific locations. There are also settings to control the labels and spawn walls displayed on the reference map, and to change the smokes depending on whether youâ€™re on attack or defense.

The main focus is simplicity - users are going to be doing this while also having their attention on the game itself, so the goal is to have the least amount of distractions as possible. It should allow users to obtain the knowledge they need in a matter of seconds through a clean and straightforward UI.

## Speed

Valoref was made using Gatsby with the intention of serving the fastest possible static site with as much rendering handled server side as possible to speed up the runtime for the end user. In addition, Valoref makes use of GraphQL and Sharp to query for images at an incredibly low latency as well as to process and allow for resize rendering at high speeds, something highly necessary when gamers are tabbing back and forth mid game round looking for strategies to implement. 

## Whats Next?

With the core app built, deployment and finding a team able to handle the daily update of icons and abilities will be the next steps to pass the current A/B testing. 

Valoref was created by Kiera Patel, Anujan Mathisekaran, and Jason Liu. Designs, UX research and more can be found at https://www.kierapatel.com/valoref.
